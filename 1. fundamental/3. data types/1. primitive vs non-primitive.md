# Primitive

Primitive values are `defined by being immutable`, they `cannot be altered`. Primitives are `passed by value`, meaning their values are copied and then placed somewhere else in the memory

- number
- string
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- Symbol

# Non-primitive

The only type that `leaves us with is objects`. Objects `are able to be mutated` and their properties `are passed by reference`, meaning their properties are not stored separately in memory

- object
