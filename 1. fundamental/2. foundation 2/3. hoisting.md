# Hoisting

Hoisting is the process of `putting all variable and function declarations into memory` during the Execution Phase

In JavaScript

- `Function Declarations are fully hoisted`
- `Var variables are hoisted` and `initialized to undefined`
- `Let and const variables are hoisted` but `not initialized a value`. They are in a status call `Temporal Dead Zone`

The hoisting happens in each Execution Context (Global or Function)
