# Why we need Call Stack and Memory Heap?

The JavaScript engine needs `a place to store and write our data` and `a place to keep track line by line of what's executing`. That's where the Call Stack and the Memory Heap come in

<br>

# Call Stack

The call stack `keeps track of where we are in the code`, so we can `run the program in order`. It runs in `a first in last out mode`.Each call stack `can point to a location inside the memory heap`

<br>

# Memory Heap

The Memory Heap `stores and writes information`, where `the memory is allocated, used, and removed`
