# What is pure function

A pure function is a function that

- Returns the same output if the same input are passed
- Cannot modify anything outside itself - no side effects

```
  const plus2number = (num1, num2) => {
    return num1 + num2;
  }
```

```
  const removeLastItem = (arr) => {
    const cloneArr = [...arr]; // not modify the array variable outside
    cloneArr.pop();

    return cloneArr;
  }
```

The idea of pure function is it makes functions `easy to test, compose` and a`void bugs` because we `have no mutations, no shared state, and can be predictable`
