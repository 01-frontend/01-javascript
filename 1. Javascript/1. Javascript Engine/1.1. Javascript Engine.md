# What is Javascript Engine?

A JavaScript engine is a computer program that `translate the JavaScript code to machine code` that computer can understand

There are many types of Javascript engines and all of them must be `standardized by ECMA Script`

- `V8`: by Google, is used in Google Chrome, Node.js, Deno, and V8.NET
- `SpiderMonkey`: A JavaScript engine in Mozilla Gecko applications, including Firefox
- `Chakra`: A JavaScript engine previously used in older versions of Microsoft Edge
- ...

The JavaScript engines are `embedded in JavaScript runtime environments` such as browsers, Node.js, or even Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

# How does the JS Engine work?

In modern engines, `the Interpreter starts reading the code line by line` while `the Profiler watches for frequently used code and flags` then `passes is to the Compiler to be optimized`

In the end, the JavaScript engine `takes the bytecode from the Interpreter outputs` and `mixes in the optimized code the Compiler outputs` and then gives that to the computer.` This is called "Just in Time" or JIT Compiler`

## 1. Parser

Parsing is the process of `analyzing the source code`, `checking it for errors`, and `decodes the code contents into tokens` that are sent to the parser

## 2. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

The parser `creates nodes based on the tokens` it receives and produces `a data structure called the Abstract Syntax Tree`

## 3. Interpreter

_Refer 3. interpreter, compiler and JIT.md_

## 4. Profiler

The Profiler will `monitors and watches code` to optimize it

## 5. Compiler

_Refer 3. interpreter, compiler and JIT.md_

## 6. Optimized code

The optimized code can be run more efficiency and faster
