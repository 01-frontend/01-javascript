# Promise

A Promise is a proxy for a `value not necessarily known` when the promise is created. Instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method `returns a promise to supply the value` at `some point in the future`

A promise has three states:

- `pending`: the promise is still in the works
- `fulfilled`: the promise resolves successfully and returns a value
- `rejected`: the promise fails with an error

```
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if(true) {
      resolve('Stuff worked');
      return;
    }

    reject('Error, it broke');
  });

  promise
    .then((result) => `${result}. Wonderful!`) // Stuff worked
    .then((result) => `Report: ${result}`) // Stuff worked. Wonderful!
    .catch((error) => console.log(error))
```
