# Lexical Environment

Lexical environment is a place where `variables and its references are stored` in the object. It consists of 2 concepts

- `Environment record` - is the actual place where the variable and function declarations are stored
- `Lexical Environment of its Parent` - means it has access to its outer (parent) lexical environment

A lexical environment conceptually looks like this:

```
  lexicalEnvironment = {
    environmentRecord: {
      <identifier> : <value>,
      <identifier> : <value>
    }
    outer: < Reference to the parent lexical environment>
  }
```

The very first lexical environment `is the global`

The lexical environment is the `fundamental of Closure`
