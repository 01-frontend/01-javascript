# Lexical Environment

A lexical scope `or static scope` in JavaScript refers to the `accessibility of the variables, functions, and objects` based on `their physical location` in the source code

A lexical environment `consists of two main components`

- `The environment record` - is the actual place where the variable and function declarations are stored
- `The reference to the outer (parent) lexical environment` - means it has access to its outer (parent) lexical environment

The very first lexical environment `is the global`

The lexical environment is the `fundamental of Closure`
