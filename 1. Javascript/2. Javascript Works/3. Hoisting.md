# Hoisting

Hoisting is the process of `putting all variable and function declarations into memory` during the Execution Phase

In JavaScript

- `Function declarations are fully hoisted`
- `Var variables are hoisted` and `initialized to undefined`
- Let and const variables `only get initialized on the line they are executed on` and `only get allocated undefined if there is no assignment` to the variable

The hoisting `happens in each Execution Context` (Global or Function)
