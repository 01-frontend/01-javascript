# Scope

Scope refers to the `accessibility of variables of functions`. That is,` which parts of a program have access` to the variable or `where the variable is visible`

In Javascript, there are 3 types of scopes

- Global Scope
- Function Scope
- Block Scope

# Scope chain

Each environment context that is created `has a reference outside of its lexical environment` called the scope chain. The scope chain gives us the `accessibility to variables in the parent environment`

```
const levelRoot = 'level root';

function func1() {
  const level1 = 'level 1';

  return function func2() {
    const level2 = 'level 2';

    return function func3() {
      const level3 = 'level 3';

      console.log(levelRoot);
      console.log(level1); // able to access the grandparent scope
      console.log(level2); // able to access the parent scope
      console.log(level3);
    }
  }
}

func1()()();

```
