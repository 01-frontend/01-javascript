# Factorial Function

A factory function is `a function` that `returns a new object`

```
  function createElf(name, weapon) {
    return {
      name,
      weapon,
      attack() {
        return `Attach with ${weapon}`
      }
    }
  }
```

Assume that we're going to create 10,000 elf, it means we have `10,000 attach functions separately on the memory`. That's `not efficiency`
