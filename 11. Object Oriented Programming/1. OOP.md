# Object-oriented programming (OOP)

OOP is a paradigm that works under the `concepts of “objects”` that `contain data in the form of fields` often referred to as attributes; `and code, in the form of procedures`, often referred to as methods

OOP rests on four key principles AIPE

- Abstraction - trừu tượng
- Inheritance - kế thừa
- Polymorphism - đa hình
- Encapsulation - đóng gói

## # Abstraction

Abstraction aims to `hide complexity from users` and `show them only relevant information`

## # Inheritance

Inheritance makes it possible to `create a child class` that `inherits the fields and methods of the parent class`

## # Polymorphism

Polymorphism refers to the `ability to perform a certain action in different ways`

## # Encapsulation

Encapsulation helps with `data security`, allowing you to `protect the data stored in a class` from system-wide access
